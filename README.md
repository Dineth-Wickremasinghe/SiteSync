# SiteSync — Construction Site Management System

SiteSync is a full-stack mobile application developed for the SE2020 – Web and Mobile Technologies module at SLIIT. It digitises day-to-day construction site operations that are traditionally managed through paper-based systems, providing a centralised, role-based platform accessible from any mobile device.
The application supports two user roles; Supervisors and Workers and covers seven core modules: worker management, project tracking, equipment inventory, daily site reports, incident reporting, and site notices. All file uploads including ID scans, blueprints, progress photos, and timesheets are stored on Cloudinary.
Built using React Native (Expo) for the frontend and Node.js + Express.js for the backend, with MongoDB Atlas as the cloud database and hosted on Azure.

## Getting Started
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Dineth-Wickremasinghe/SiteSync


### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+
- Expo CLI
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Cloudinary account

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SiteSync.git
cd SiteSync/backend
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
PORT=5000
```

4. Start the backend server
```bash
npm start
```

The server runs on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder
```bash
cd SiteSync/frontend
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Update the base URL in `services/api.js`
```javascript
baseURL: 'http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:5000/api'
```
> Use your machine's local IP address (e.g. `192.168.1.x`), not `localhost`, so the app can connect from a physical device or emulator.

4. Start Expo
```bash
npx expo start
```

## Environment Variables

Never commit your `.env` file to GitHub. Each team member must create their own `.env` file locally using the variables listed above.

If you are connecting from a different machine, make sure your IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas under **Network Access**. For development, setting it to `0.0.0.0/0` (Allow Access from Anywhere) is recommended.
